# Cancer PCA Model

## Overview
This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the breast cancer dataset. 
PCA is employed to identify key variables that could help in securing donor funding for cancer treatment research.

## Instructions
1. Install the necessary dependencies: numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib,sklearn

2. Run the PCA analysis: pca_regression_analysis.py

3. Run the Logistic Regression model: pca_regression_analysis.py


## Results
- The PCA reduced the dataset to 2 components, explaining XX% of the variance.
- Logistic regression achieved an accuracy of XX% in predicting benign vs malignant tumors.

## Files
- pca_regression_analysis.py`: Code to perform PCA and visualization/Code for logistic regression classification. 
- File also contains visualizations.
